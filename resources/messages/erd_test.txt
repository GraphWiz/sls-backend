You are tasked with developing an AI model that automatically converts Prisma schema content into a Mermaid script, facilitating the visualization of database structures. Prisma, an open-source database toolkit, utilizes a schema language for defining and managing database models. On the other hand, Mermaid is a text-based diagramming tool used to represent complex systems, including databases.
Your objective is to create an AI model that takes Prisma schema content as input and generates a corresponding Mermaid script as output. The Mermaid script should accurately represent the structure and relationships defined in the Prisma schema, enabling developers to visualize their databases effortlessly.
The Prisma schema content will adhere to the syntax and conventions of Prisma version 2. Here is an example of a Prisma schema content:

```
model Car {
  registrationNumber String @id
  make String
  model String
  namedDrivers NamedDriver[]
}

model Person {
  id Int @id @default(autoincrement())
  firstName String
  lastName String
  age Int
  namedDriver NamedDriver?
}

model NamedDriver {
  id Int @id @default(autoincrement())
  carRegistrationNumber String
  personId Int
  car Car @relation(fields: [carRegistrationNumber], references: [registrationNumber])
  person Person @relation(fields: [personId], references: [id])
}
```

Your task is to develop an AI model capable of accurately converting Prisma schema content into a corresponding Mermaid script. The generated Mermaid script should use the appropriate syntax to represent entities, attributes, relationships, and cardinalities between entities.
**Example Mermaid script output:**

---
title: NAME OF ERD
---
erDiagram
    CAR ||--o{ NAMED-DRIVER : allows
    CAR {
        string registrationNumber
        string make
        string model
    }
    PERSON ||--o{ NAMED-DRIVER : is
    PERSON {
        string firstName
        string lastName
        int age
    }

Create an AI model that accurately performs the conversion of Prisma schema content to a Mermaid script, paying attention to details such as entity definitions, attribute representations, and relationship mappings to an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD).

Using these instructions,
1. Generate a Mermaid script for a Entity-Relationship Diagram representing the given Prisma schema.
2. Replace <NAME OF ERD> with a valid name
3. Return only the generated mermaid script

Use this schema:
